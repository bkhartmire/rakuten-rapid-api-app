# DethKlock

DethKlok was completed during our time as students at Code Chrysalis. It is a project designed to use the API's on [Rakuten Rapid API's platform](https://english.api.rakuten.net/). This application takes a user birthday input and returns a collection of fascinating data:

- How many days you've been alive
- Based on IP address country's average life expectancy rates, how many years left you have to live
- A notable person who died on the day you born
- A notable person who you share the same birthday with
- The #1 Billboard hit song the day you were born
- Historical event trivia about the day you were born
- Historical event trivia about the year you were born
- All of the NY Times articles published on the day you were born
